# Network_Chat_Application_using_Flask_API
Contains my code for an attempt on trying to create a local host-based chat interface for two people to be able to chat, if they exist on the same wifi network when this application is hosted on that host network. 

# Frontend -> HTML, CSS
# Backend -> Python's Flask API, Javascript for network chat functionality.

Although This project is not complete and the functionalities are not completely implemented, this network chat application is set to search for 0.0.0.0. so that, it searches for all the devices on a network and pings the chat interface to them. 

This project is still under construction and I have a lot to research, learn, code and complete the project with. 

Feel free to reach out for suggestions. 

Enjoy.
